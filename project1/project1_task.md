# Project 1 Task

## Project

The idea is that you now apply everything we learned so far yourself.

This is what you need to do for each project:

* Think of a problem that's interesting for you
* Describe this problem
* Create the frontend, backend and describe their communication with API specs
  * You can do it in any order:
  * Frontend first, like shown in the course
  * Specs first
  * Backend first
  * But all three have to be done
* Make sure the application is thouroughly tested, containerized and deployed
* Make sure you review your peers - or you won't get a certificate of graduation

## Criteria

1. Problem description (README)

* The problem is not described. (0 points)
* The problem is described briefly, but it is unclear what the system does or what functionality is expected. (1 point)
* The README clearly describes the problem, the system’s functionality, and what the project is expected to do. (2 points)

1. AI system development (tools, workflow, MCP)

* No description of how the system was built or how AI tools were used. (0 points)
* The project describes how AI tools were used to build the system (e.g. coding assistants, prompts, workflows, AGENTS.md or similar guidance). (1 point)
* The project clearly documents AI-assisted system development and additionally describes how MCP was used (e.g. MCP server, tools, or workflow). (2 points)

1. Technologies and system architecture

* Technologies used in the project are not described or are unclear. (0 points)
* The main technologies are mentioned (e.g. frontend framework, backend framework, database), but without explaining their roles. (1 point)
* The project clearly describes the technologies used (frontend, backend, database, containerization, CI/CD) and explains how they fit into the system architecture. (2 points)

1. Front-end implementation

* No front-end or non-functional front-end. (0 points)
* A functional front-end exists, but structure is unclear or backend calls are scattered. (1 point)
* Front-end is functional and well-structured, with centralized backend communication. (2 points)
* Front-end is functional, well-structured, and includes tests covering core logic, with clear instructions on how to run them. (3 points)

1. API contract (OpenAPI specifications)

* No OpenAPI specification. (0 points)
* OpenAPI specification exists but is incomplete or loosely aligned with front-end needs. (1 point)
* OpenAPI specification fully reflects front-end requirements and is used as the contract for backend development. (2 points)

1. Back-end implementation

* No back-end or back-end does not follow the API contract. (0 points)
* Back-end implements required endpoints but has limited structure or documentation. (1 point)
* Back-end is well-structured and follows the OpenAPI specifications. (2 points)
* Back-end is well-structured, follows the OpenAPI specifications, and includes tests covering core functionality, clearly documented. (3 points)

1. Database integration

* No database or persistent storage. (0 points)
* Database is integrated, but configuration or usage is minimal or poorly documented. (1 point)
* Database layer is properly integrated, supports different environments (e.g. SQLite and Postgres), and is documented. (2 points)

1. Containerization

* No containerization. (0 points)
* Dockerfiles exist, but running the full system requires manual steps. (1 point)
* The entire system runs via Docker or docker-compose with clear instructions. (2 points)

1. Integration testing

* No integration tests. (0 points)
* Integration tests exist but are limited or not clearly separated from unit tests. (1 point)
* Integration tests are clearly separated, cover key workflows (including database interactions), and are documented. (2 points)

1. Deployment

* Application is not deployed. (0 points)
* Deployment steps are described, but no working deployment is shown. (1 point)
* Application is deployed to the cloud with a working URL or clear proof of deployment. (2 points)

1. CI/CD pipeline

* No CI/CD pipeline. (0 points)
* CI pipeline runs tests automatically. (1 point)
* CI/CD pipeline runs tests and deploys the application when tests pass. (2 points)

1. Reproducibility

* Project cannot be run with the provided instructions. (0 points)
* Project can be run, but setup or run instructions are incomplete. (1 point)
* Clear instructions exist to set up, run, test, and deploy the system end-to-end. (2 points)
